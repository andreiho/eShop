In your webshop, you sell local products as well as products from partners. Your website will display:

	[ ] Your partner’s products from XML and/or JSON and save them into your own database
	[x] Your local products fetched directly from own database
	[ ] Products from partners will also be fetched from your own database

When a user buys a product (just by clicking the “buy” button):

	[ ] If the product is local, the client gets an email with purchase information. (Select * from products where product_id = 1)
	[ ] If the product is local,  the system saves the purchase information
	[ ] If the product is from a partner, the system keeps the commission and sends the order and money (after taking the comission out) to the partner. This is done with a web-service.

In your webshop the user/buyer/client will be able to:

	[ ] Search for products. The page will display local as well as partner’s products. Done with the “like” keyword in MySQL
	[ ] Buy (click and buy, no payment, no credit card, just pretend the user entered all needed data)
	[ ] Get an email when he/she buys a product. The buyers must write her email somewhere. If you want, the client also writes her mobile number to get an SMS with the order

In your webshop the partner can:
	[x] Login to upload the path to her XML and JSON API
	[ ] Get an order coming from your own system
	[ ] Get money from a sale that you make in your system, but the product was from the partner
